# Implementation

## Installation and validation
 - Checkout the repository in a folder and run `composer install`
 - Test with `composer test`.
 - Validate code standards with `composer cs`. 

## Open questions
 - How the platform should behave in case of multiple defaults.
 - Is a 2-step currency conversion valid (I think so), when there is a no
   direct conversion step defined in the input?
